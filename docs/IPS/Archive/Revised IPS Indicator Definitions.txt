DXY Index (Leading, 30%)

Calculation: Month-end close value
Signal Period: 3-month rate of change (shortened from simple level)
Normalization: 15-year percentiles of 3-month changes

Signal Period: Inverted ratio (Call/Put for bullish signal)
Normalization: 15-year percentiles of smoothed monthly values
Rationale: Reduces single-day noise while maintaining options sentiment signal

Trailing P/E (Concurrent, 40%)

Calculation: S&P 500 index level P/E
Signal Period: Current vs 3-month average
Normalization: 15-year percentiles of deviation from 3-month average
Rationale: Identifies rapid valuation shifts vs slow trend

EPS Delivery (Lagging, 30%)

Calculation: S&P 500 actual EPS / Initial consensus (index level)
Signal Period: 4-quarter moving average of beat rate
Normalization: 15-year percentiles
Rationale: Smooths quarterly volatility, captures execution trends

US Leadership Theme
SPY/EFA Momentum (Leading, 30%)

Calculation: SPY/EFA price ratio
Signal Period: 6-month rate of change (reduced from 12)
Normalization: 15-year percentiles of 6-month momentum
Rationale: Balances responsiveness with stability

US Market Cap % (Concurrent, 40%)

Calculation: SPY market cap / (SPY + EFA + EEM)
Signal Period: Month-over-month change in percentage
Normalization: 15-year percentiles of monthly changes
Rationale: Captures allocation shifts not just absolute dominance

ETF Flow Differential (Lagging, 30%)

Calculation: Actual fund flows required (not volume)
Signal Period: 3-month cumulative flows (US - International)
Data Source: ETF.com, Morningstar Direct, or Bloomberg
Normalization: 15-year percentiles of 3-month flows
Fallback: If flows unavailable, use (SPY AUM change - EFA AUM change)
Rationale: 3-month captures quarterly rebalancing cycles

Implementation Notes
Responsiveness Improvements:

Average signal lag reduced from ~6 months to ~2 months
8 of 12 indicators now use change rates vs absolute levels
Smoothing periods calibrated to balance signal vs noise

GARCH Compatibility:

Change-based indicators better suited for volatility modeling
Consistent monthly frequency across all indicators
Minimum 180 monthly observations for all indicators

Data Quality Priorities:

Critical: Source actual ETF flow data
Important: Implement 5-day Put/Call averaging
Important: Convert EPS to S&P 500 index level
Monitor: Tech employment for AI-driven inversion

Transition Probability Impact:
These shorter periods will increase transition probabilities between states, making the portfolio more dynamic. Consider adjusting rebalancing frequency from quarterly to monthly if volatility increases.


### IPS v4.3 Draft Addition - Structural Trend Indicators

#### New Indicator Classification: Trending vs Cyclical

**Problem Statement:**
Some indicators represent structural trends rather than mean-reverting cycles. COFER USD reserve share, for example, has declined from ~70% to ~58% over 20 years. This isn't a cyclical oscillation but a structural trend. Analyzing it with percentiles or GARCH volatility misrepresents its signal.

**Solution Framework:**
For trending indicators, compare short-term vs long-term slopes to detect acceleration/deceleration of the trend.

#### Trending Indicator: COFER USD Reserve Share

**Analysis Method:**
- **Short-term window:** 6 months (captures recent momentum)
- **Long-term window:** 60 months (5-year structural trend)
- **Signal calculation:** Acceleration = Short-term slope - Long-term slope
- **Normalization:** tanh(acceleration / 0.01) for [-1, 1] range
- **Inversion:** For declining indicators, -signal (deceleration = bullish)

**Interpretation:**
- **Strong Bullish (+0.5 to +1.0):** USD share decline decelerating significantly
- **Mild Bullish (+0.2 to +0.5):** USD share decline moderating
- **Neutral (-0.2 to +0.2):** USD share decline steady
- **Bearish (-0.5 to -1.0):** USD share decline accelerating

**Rationale:**
- COFER declining from 70% to 58% isn't inherently bearish
- What matters is whether the decline is accelerating (bearish) or decelerating (bullish)
- This captures turning points in structural trends

#### Other Potential Trending Indicators

**Under Investigation:**
1. **us_market_pct:** US share of global equity markets (likely trending)
2. **tech_employment_pct:** Technology sector employment (structural digitization trend)
3. **productivity_growth:** May require hybrid approach (cyclical around trend)

**Classification Criteria:**
- **Trending:** Long-term directional movement without mean reversion
- **Cyclical:** Oscillates around stable mean or slow-moving average
- **Hybrid:** Cyclical variations around structural trend

#### Implementation Notes
- Maintain full signal strength (no artificial dampening)
- Leading indicators should not have muted signals
- Output remains [-1, 1] for consistency with framework


### Innovation Theme - Lagging Indicator Change

**Replacing**: tech_employment_pct
**With**: software_ip_investment_pct

**Rationale**: 
- Tech employment % has declined since 2012 despite innovation boom
- Likely reflects classification issues or productivity gains
- Software/IP investment better captures innovation adoption

**New Indicator**: Software & IP Investment (% of Private Fixed Investment)
- **Source**: FRED Y033RC1Q027SBEA / W170RC1Q027SBEA
- **Update Frequency**: Quarterly
- **History**: 1999-present
- **Interpretation**: Companies invest in software/IP AFTER innovation proves valuable
- **Current Level**: ~20% (historical high)
