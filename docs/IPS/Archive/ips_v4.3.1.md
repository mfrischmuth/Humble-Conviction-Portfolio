# Investment Policy Statement (IPS) Framework
## Version 4.3.1 - Unified Framework with Factor Adjustments
**Last Updated:** September 08, 2025, 00:15:00 UTC  
**Status:** Framework Definition with Factor Matrix
**Filename:** IPS_v4.3.1_With_Factor_Matrix.md

## Executive Summary

Version 4.3 unifies the data collection framework from IPS v4.2 with the portfolio construction methodology from IPS v3.11, adapted for a richer 81-scenario framework based on ternary theme states.

**Key Innovation**: Instead of 16 binary scenarios (themes either on/off), the framework now models 81 scenarios where each theme can be weak (-1), neutral (0), or strong (+1), providing more nuanced portfolio optimization while preserving the sophisticated regret minimization approach.

**Core Principle**: Let statistical models handle complexity without arbitrary calibrations. Pure GARCH estimation, percentile-based normalization, and data-driven theme state determination replace manual adjustments.

**Version 4.3.1 Addition**: Factor adjustment matrix for translating theme states into portfolio tilts.

## Part I: Data Collection and Theme Framework (from v4.2)

### Four Macro Themes with Three States

The portfolio framework monitors four macro themes, each determined by three indicators with different temporal characteristics:

1. **USD Dominance** (Weak/Neutral/Strong)
2. **Innovation Environment** (Weak/Neutral/Strong)  
3. **Valuation Dynamics** (Low/Neutral/High)
4. **US Market Leadership** (Weak/Neutral/Strong)

### Indicator Framework (12 Total)

| Theme | Temporal | Indicator | Field Name | Source |
|-------|----------|-----------|------------|--------|
| **USD** | Leading | DXY Index | `dxy_index` | Yahoo Finance |
| | Concurrent | Real Rate Differential | `real_rate_differential` | FRED |
| | Lagging | IMF COFER Reserve Share | `cofer_usd` | IMF Quarterly |
| **Innovation** | Leading | QQQ/SPY Ratio | `qqq_spy_ratio` | Yahoo Finance |
| | Concurrent | US Productivity Growth | `productivity_growth` | FRED |
| | Lagging | Tech Employment % | `tech_employment_pct` | FRED |
| **Valuation** | Leading | Put/Call Ratio | `put_call_ratio` | CBOE |
| | Concurrent | Trailing P/E | `trailing_pe` | Yahoo Finance |
| | Lagging | EPS Delivery Rate | `eps_delivery` | Calculated |
| **US Leadership** | Leading | SPY/EFA Momentum | `spy_efa_momentum` | Yahoo Finance |
| | Concurrent | US Market % of Global | `us_market_pct` | Calculated |
| | Lagging | ETF Flow Differential | `etf_flow_differential` | Volume Proxy |

### Statistical Processing

**GARCH Configuration:**
- Trend Lookback: 24 months
- GARCH Lookback: 180 months (15 years)
- Percentile Calculation: 180 months
- Minimum History Required: 60 months

**Theme State Determination:**
- Bottom tercile (â‰¤33rd percentile): State = -1 (Weak/Low)
- Middle tercile (33rd-67th percentile): State = 0 (Neutral)
- Top tercile (â‰¥67th percentile): State = +1 (Strong/High)

**NO arbitrary calibrations** - GARCH models and percentile transformations handle all normalization.

### Scenario Generation

With 4 themes Ã— 3 states each = **81 possible scenarios**

Each scenario is identified by a 4-element vector [USD, Innovation, Valuation, USLeadership] where each element âˆˆ {-1, 0, +1}.

Example scenarios:
- [0, 0, 0, 0]: All themes neutral (baseline scenario)
- [+1, +1, -1, -1]: USD strong, Innovation strong, Valuation low, US Leadership weak
- [-1, 0, +1, +1]: USD weak, Innovation neutral, Valuation high, US Leadership strong

## Part II: Portfolio Construction Framework (adapted from v3.11)

### Investment Objectives

**Primary:** Achieve 8-12% annual returns across market cycles  
**Secondary:** Limit maximum drawdown to 15% in any 12-month period  
**Tertiary:** Maintain liquidity for opportunistic investments

### Security Universe (12 Assets)

**Equity Exposures (5):**
- VTI: US Total Market (core domestic)
- VEA: Developed International (core international)
- VWO: Emerging Markets (emerging exposure)
- SMH: Semiconductors (innovation theme expression)
- SRVR: Infrastructure/Data Centers (innovation infrastructure)

**Income Exposures (2):**
- PIMIX: PIMCO Income Fund (hold-only, no new purchases)
- PYLD: PIMCO Yield Opportunities (primary income vehicle)

**Alternative Exposures (4):**
- GLD: Gold (USD hedge, crisis protection)
- COM: Commodities (real asset exposure)
- IGF: Global Infrastructure (inflation protection)
- DBMF: Managed Futures (crisis alpha, hedging)

**Cash (1):**
- SWVXX: Money Market (liquidity, defensive)

### Portfolio Optimization Methodology

#### Step 1: Scenario Selection
From 81 possible scenarios:
1. Sort by probability (highest first)
2. Include until cumulative probability â‰¥ 85%
3. Minimum 3 scenarios, maximum 6
4. Include any scenario â‰¥ 10% probability regardless

#### Step 2: Individual Scenario Optimization

**Baseline Portfolio (60/30/10):**
- Equity (60%): VTI 30%, VEA 15%, VWO 7%, SMH 5%, SRVR 3%
- Income (30%): PYLD 25%, PIMIX 5%
- Alternatives (10%): GLD 3%, COM 2%, IGF 2%, DBMF 2%, SWVXX 1%

**Factor Adjustment Matrix:**

Each security receives adjustments based on the state of each theme. Adjustments are additive across themes.

```

```

**Portfolio Construction Process:**
1. Start with baseline allocation
2. Apply factor adjustments based on scenario states
3. Sum adjustments across all four themes
4. Normalize to 100%

#### Step 3: Regret Matrix Calculation
Calculate regret for each portfolio in each scenario:
```
Regret(Portfolio_A, Scenario_B) = Return(Portfolio_A, Scenario_B) - Return(Optimal_B, Scenario_B)
```

#### Step 4: Dual Optimization
Minimize combined objective:
```
Î± Ã— Max_Regret + (1-Î±) Ã— Probability_Weighted_Regret
```
Where Î± âˆˆ [0.3, 0.7] balances worst-case protection vs expected outcome

#### Step 5: Smart Hedging Protocol
If maximum regret exceeds tolerance:
- Assess portfolio correlation across scenarios
- Add hedging based on divergence type
- Maximum hedge additions: 15% of portfolio

#### Step 6: Final Validation
- Apply security-specific rules (PIMIX hold-only, PYLD primary income)
- Ensure minimum cash position (1%)
- Position limits under consideration (not currently enforced)

### Rebalancing Framework

**Quarterly Full Optimization:** Third Friday of March, June, September, December

**Monthly Drift Check:** First Friday of each month
- Trigger if any position >3% drift or total >10% drift

**Security-Specific Rules:**
- PIMIX: Hold-only (never generate BUY orders)
- PYLD: Primary vehicle for income allocation increases
- Minimum cash: 1% always maintained

### Risk Management

**Position Limits (Under Consideration):**
- Maximum single position: 35%
- Maximum sector concentration: 50%
- Maximum alternatives: 30%

**Active Risk Limits:**
- Maximum regret in any likely scenario: -8%
- Minimum upside capture: 70%

## Part III: Implementation Status

### Currently Implemented
- âœ… Data collection framework (IPS v4.2)
- âœ… 12 indicators with automated collection
- âœ… GARCH volatility estimation (15-year lookback)
- âœ… Theme state calculation (ternary: -1, 0, +1)
- âœ… 81-scenario generation

### Under Development
- ðŸ”„ Portfolio optimization for 81 scenarios
- ðŸ”„ Expected return modeling
- ðŸ”„ Regret matrix calculations

### Design Decisions Pending
- Expected return modeling details
- Integration of theme probabilities with scenario selection
- Position limit enforcement strategy

## Example Portfolio Calculation

**Scenario:** [-1, +1, +1, 0] (Weak USD, Strong Innovation, High Valuation, Neutral US Leadership)

Starting from baseline and applying factor adjustments:
- VTI: 30% â†’ -10% +10% -10% +0% = 20% raw â†’ **11.5%** normalized
- VEA: 15% â†’ +10% +2% -5% +0% = 22% raw â†’ **12.6%** normalized
- GLD: 3% â†’ +15% -5% +15% +0% = 28% raw â†’ **16.1%** normalized
- PYLD: 25% â†’ +2% -8% +12% +0% = 31% raw â†’ **17.8%** normalized

Final portfolio emphasizes defensive positioning (high GLD, PYLD) appropriate for weak dollar and high valuation environment.
