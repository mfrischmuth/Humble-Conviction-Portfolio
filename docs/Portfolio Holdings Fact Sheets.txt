How your fund can affect your taxes
A fund's capital gains and losses can reveal the tax implications of holding a particular fund in a taxable account. This is true of both realized and unrealized capital gains and losses.


These tax implications don't apply to investors holding a fund in a tax-deferred account, such as an IRA or employer-sponsored retirement plan.

Fund management
Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF seeks to track the investment performance of the CRSP US Total Market Index, which represents approximately 100% of the investable U.S. stock market and includes large-, mid-, small-, and micro-cap stocks regularly traded on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. The fund invests by sampling the index, meaning that it holds a broadly diversified collection of securities that, in the aggregate, approximates the full Index in terms of key characteristics. These key characteristics include industry weightings and market capitalization, as well as certain financial measures such as price/earnings ratio and dividend yield. The experience and stability of Vanguard’s Equity Index Group have permitted continuous refinement of techniques for reducing tracking error. The group uses proprietary software to implement trading decisions that accommodate cash flow and maintain close correlation with index characteristics. Vanguard’s refined indexing process, combined with low management fees and efficient trading, has provided tight tracking net of expenses.

Risks associated with aggressive funds
Vanguard funds classified as aggressive are subject to extremely wide fluctuations in share prices. The unusually high volatility associated with these funds may stem from one or more of the following strategies: a concentration of fund holdings in a relatively low number of individual stocks, or in a particular sector of the stock market, or in a particular geographical region of the world; a heavy emphasis on small-capitalization stocks or growth stocks with relatively high market valuations; holdings of international stocks or bonds, which are subject to price declines caused by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies; or investments in bonds that have exceptionally long average durations, whose prices are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.

Product summary
Invests in stocks of companies located in emerging markets around the world, such as China, Brazil, Taiwan, and South Africa.
Goal is to closely track the return of the FTSE Emerging Markets All Cap China A Inclusion Index.
Has high potential for growth, but also high risk; share value may swing up and down more than that of stock funds that invest in developed countries, including the United States.
Only appropriate for long-term goals.
With respect to 75% of its total assets, the fund may not: (1) purchase more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or (2) purchase securities of any issuer if, as a result, more than 5% of the fund’s total assets would be invested in that issuer’s securities; except as may be necessary to approximate the composition of its target index. This limitation does not apply to obligations of the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities.

The performance data shown represent past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that investors' shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data cited. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.

Risks associated with aggressive funds
Vanguard funds classified as aggressive are subject to extremely wide fluctuations in share prices. The unusually high volatility associated with these funds may stem from one or more of the following strategies: a concentration of fund holdings in a relatively low number of individual stocks, or in a particular sector of the stock market, or in a particular geographical region of the world; a heavy emphasis on small-capitalization stocks or growth stocks with relatively high market valuations; holdings of international stocks or bonds, which are subject to price declines caused by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies; or investments in bonds that have exceptionally long average durations, whose prices are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.

How your fund can affect your taxes
A fund's capital gains and losses can reveal the tax implications of holding a particular fund in a taxable account. This is true of both realized and unrealized capital gains and losses.


These tax implications don't apply to investors holding a fund in a tax-deferred account, such as an IRA or employer-sponsored retirement plan.

Morningstar Ratings: When applicable, ratings shown when the ETF is rated three stars or more for any given period. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

This graph illustrates a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the ETF invested at NAV. Returns reflect capital appreciation and the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any, as well as all fees and expenses. The Index is unmanaged and includes the reinvestment of all dividends, but does not reflect the payment of transaction costs, advisory fees or expenses that are associated with an investment in the ETF. An index's performance is not illustrative of the Fund's performance. Indices are not securities in which investments can be made. Results reflect past performance and do not guarantee future results.

Calendar Year Returns (%) 
as of  12/31/2024
The chart presents past performance which is no guarantee of future results and which may be lower or higher than current performance. Returns reflect temporary contractual fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements. Had the ETF incurred all expenses and fees, investment returns would have been reduced. Investment returns and ETF share values will fluctuate so that investors' shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. ETF returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV.

ETF implied liquidity is a representation of how many shares can potentially be traded daily in an ETF as portrayed by the creation unit. This is defined as the smallest value of the IDTS (Implied Daily Tradable Shares) for each holding in the creation unit. NAV (net asset value) is the value of one share of the Fund calculated daily. The NAV return is based on the NAV of the Fund. It may not reflect the actual return for the investor. Market Price is the price investors can buy and sell ETF shares for in the stock market and is used to calculate market return. It is based on the price at the listed exchange market close. This is when NAV is determined for most ETFs. If shares trade at another time, the return may differ. Market and NAV returns assume that dividends and capital gain distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at Market Price and NAV, respectively.

Detailed Holdings and Analytics  
Holdings are subject to change.

The values shown for “market value,” “weight,” and “notional value” (the “calculated values”) are based off of a price provided by a third-party pricing vendor for the portfolio holding and do not reflect the impact of systematic fair valuation (“the vendor price”). The vendor price is not necessarily the price at which the Fund values the portfolio holding for the purposes of determining its net asset value (the “valuation price”). Holdings data shown reflects the investment book of record, which may differ from the accounting book of record used for the purposes of determining the Net Assets of the Fund. Notional value represents the portfolio's exposures based on the economic value of investments and options are delta-adjusted. Additionally, where applicable, foreign currency exchange rates with respect to the portfolio holdings denominated in non-U.S. currencies for the valuation price will be generally determined as of the close of business on the New York Stock Exchange, whereas for the vendor price will be generally determined as of 4 p.m. London. The calculated values may have been different if the valuation price were to have been used to calculate such values. The vendor price is as of the most recent date for which a price is available and may not necessarily be as of the date shown above.

Please see the “Determination of Net Asset Value” section of each Fund’s prospectus for additional information on the Fund’s valuation policies and procedures.

“Quantity” represents the number of shares, units or contracts of the corresponding security, as applicable per security type.

The Net Expense Ratio reflects a contractual fee waiver and/or expense reduction, which is in place through 10/31/2025 and renews automatically for a full year unless terminated by PIMCO in accordance with the terms of the agreement. See the Fund’s prospectus for more information.


The Adjusted Expense Ratio is the same as the Net Expense Ratio, but also excludes certain investment expenses, such as interest expense from borrowings and repurchase agreements and dividend expense from investments on short sales, incurred directly by the Fund or indirectly through the Fund’s investments in underlying PIMCO Funds (if applicable), none of which are paid to PIMCO.

Performance quoted represents past performance. Past performance is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so that Fund shares may be worth more or less than their original cost when sold. Performance data current to the most recent month-end is available by clicking HERE or call 888-400-4ETF.


Growth of $10,000 is calculated at NAV and assumes that all dividend and capital gain distributions were reinvested. It does not take into account sales charges or the effect of taxes. Results are not indicative of future performance.


See below for a description of how market price is determined.

Differences in the Fund’s performance versus the index and related attribution information with respect to particular categories of securities or individual positions may be attributable, in part, to differences in the pricing methodologies used by the Fund and the index.

There is no assurance that any fund, including any fund that has experienced high or unusual performance for one or more periods, will experience similar levels of performance in the future. High performance is defined as a significant increase in either 1) a fund’s total return in excess of that of the fund’s benchmark between reporting periods or 2) a fund’s total return in excess of the fund’s historical returns between reporting periods. Unusual performance is defined as a significant change in a fund’s performance as compared to one or more previous reporting periods.Read More

Performance quoted represents past performance. Past performance is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results. Investment return and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate. Shares may be worth more or less than original cost when redeemed. Current performance may be lower or higher than performance shown. For performance current to the most recent month-end, visit www.pimco.com or call (888) 87-PIMCO.


Total return performance does not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares. The minimum initial investment for Institutional class shares is $1 million; however, it may be modified for certain financial intermediaries who submit trades on behalf of eligible investors.


Daily YTD return is from the most recent calendar year end.

Growth of $10,000 is calculated at NAV and assumes that all dividend and capital gain distributions were reinvested. It does not take into account sales charges or the effect of taxes. Results are not indicative of future performance.


Differences in the Fund’s performance versus the index and related attribution information with respect to particular categories of securities or individual positions may be attributable, in part, to differences in the pricing methodologies used by the Fund and the index.

There is no assurance that any fund, including any fund that has experienced high or unusual performance for one or more periods, will experience similar levels of performance in the future. High performance is defined as a significant increase in either 1) a fund’s total return in excess of that of the fund’s benchmark between reporting periods or 2) a fund’s total return in excess of the fund’s historical returns between reporting periods. Unusual performance is defined as a significant change in a fund’s performance as compared to one or more previous reporting periods.

Certain Funds may offer a share class with an inception date which is different than the inception date of the Fund. For the periods prior to the inception date of a share class, performance information is based on the performance of the Fund’s oldest class shares, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses paid by that class of shares.Read More

Total Return (As of 09/30/2021) Cumulative   QTD YTD NAV (%) Market Value (%) LBMA Gold Price PM(%)-1.25-8.12 The Price of Gold The spot price for gold bullion is determined by market forces in the 24-hour global over-the-counter (OTC) market for gold. The OTC market accounts for most global gold trading, and prices quoted reflect the information available to the market at any given time. The price, holdings, and net asset value of the Gold Shares, as well as market data for the overall gold bullion market, can be tracked daily at spdrgoldshares.com.

Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so you may have a gain or loss when shares are sold. Current performance may be higher or lower than that quoted. Visit ssga.com for most recent month-end performance. The market price used to calculate the Market Value return is the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest offer on the exchange on which the shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund’s NAV is calculated. If you trade your shares at another time, your return may differ. Effective March 20, 2015, the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) adopted the LBMA Gold Price PM as the reference benchmark price of gold in calculating the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Trust. Prior to that date, the Trust used the London PM Fix as the reference benchmark price in calculating the NAV. ‡The gross expense ratio is the Trust’s annual operating expense ratio.  See the Trust’s most recent prospectus for a definition of Trust expenses.

The price, holdings and net asset value of the Gold Shares, as well as market data for the overall gold bullion market, can be tracked daily at spdrgoldshares.com. For many investors, the transaction costs related to the Shares are expected to be lower than the costs associated with the purchase, storage and insurance of physical gold.

Strategy & Benefits
Strategy Description

A 40 Act, non K-1 generating approach to commodity investing
Exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be long or flat (if a short signal is triggered the position is moved to cash)
The ability to make position changes intra-month based on trends
Month-end review where the position size of each component is modified if volatility exceeds certain predetermined risk levels
A “smart” contract roll approach designed to select cost effective futures contracts to roll into upon expiration of current contract.
Why Consider Long/Flat Commodities?

Most traditional commodity funds can only benefit if commodity prices rise. However, these long-only commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because:

Commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic
Individual commodity sub-sectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments
Significant draw-downs can be damaging to the long-term performance of a portfolio
Within the inherently volatile commodity markets, a long/flat approach is potentially more adaptive to whip-sawing market conditions.

*The Fund’s adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Services Agreement with the Fund. Under this Operating Services Agreement, Rafferty has contractually agreed to pay all expenses of the Fund as long as it is the advisor of the Fund other than the following: management fees, Rule 12b-1 distribution and/or service fees, taxes, swap financing and related costs, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions, expenses incurred in connection with any merger or reorganization, acquired fund fees and expenses, and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.

The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at www.direxioninvestments.com.

Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.
